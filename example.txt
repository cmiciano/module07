<form>

</form>





In this module we learned how to work with forms using React.
We learned about controlled and uncontrolled components.
We used the fetch method to update an employee with a specific ID.
The PATH method is used to convert the data to JSON.
Controlled components are the most common way to handle forms.
Uncontrolled components use refs to manage forms.
Form Validation can be handled with HTML5 validation, or libraries like Formik or React Hook Form.
Yup is also used Formik for schema-based form validation.
